This is a project I was working on for a while to completely change my PC desktop with Electron and Autohotkey. It worked as a completely customizable desktop environment that interacted with specific mouse movements and buttons. I usxe a Razer Naga Trinity with 12 buttons on the side, and each of those buttons did different things.

That said, when I tried to commit my changes, there was an issue with my computer, and it corrupted a large chunk of my updated code. Because of this, I pretty much just stopped working on it. I would like to revisit it one day, but I think this kind of application would be best written in something like C# (or C++ or C), and I would love to jump into that, because I have a huge interest in C#, but I am also working on a private repo for a site that is very near and dear to my heart.
